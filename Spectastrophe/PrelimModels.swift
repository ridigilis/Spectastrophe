Let's start with the bones. The stuff and things I know will be in the game regardless of where iteration takes it.
- There will be a PLAYER.
- The PLAYER will have a DECK of CARDS.
- The PLAYER will engage in ENCOUNTERS.
- ENCOUNTERS take place in hex TILE arenas.
- ENCOUNTERS will have ENEMIES.
- The PLAYER and ENEMIES will take turns playing all CARDS from their HAND.
- Playing CARDS from HAND will trigger various ACTIONS.
- ACTIONS include movement/navigation around the ENCOUNTER arena.
- ACTIONS also include ways to increase or decrease other resources that can be used for various reasons.
- ACTIONS also include ways for the PLAYER to engage with ENEMIES and viceversa, like attacks and spells.
- ACTIONS more often than not will trigger dice rolls that determine the result of the action.
- Some CARDS that are played go to the DISCARD PILE.
- When the DECK has been depleted, the DISCARD PILE is shuffled back into the DECK.
- Some CARDS can also be exhausted (removed from play entirely) through various means.
- Some CARDS, when played, are equipped by the PLAYER. Let's call them GEAR CARDS.
- GEAR CARDS, when equipped, may add more CARDS to the PLAYER'S DECK of CARDS.
- The PLAYER will need to defeat all ENEMIES in an ENCOUNTER in order to move onto the next ENCOUNTER.
- ENEMIES and the PLAYER are considered defeated when their hit points reach zero or less.
- ENEMIES may drop CARDS from their own DECK when defeated.
- The PLAYER can pick up dropped CARDS if they are on the TILE with the drop on it.
- The PLAYER may also be rewarded with CARDS after completing an ENCOUNTER.
- The PLAYER will choose which ENCOUNTER to attempt next on the OVERWORLD/MAP after completing an ENCOUNTER.

I think that's plenty to work with for now. Let's make some models!
