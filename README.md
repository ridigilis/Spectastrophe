# Spectastrophe
Spectastrophe (working title) is a game I'm building in Swift/SwiftUI with the following contstraints:
- I must only use SwiftUI for rendering (so no *Kits specifically intended for game development)
- I cannot use any external dependencies (unless its a dev tool like swiftlint)
- I have to create and use my own assets
- I have to do it all in public

Why? So I can ring a few gongs with one bong:
- git gud at Swift and SwiftUI fast; I just started learning it a few months ago and I'd like to pay the bills with it, ideally
- develop a deeper understanding of game design and development by implementing the engine from scratch
- confront my social anxieties and other personal struggles so they'll stop holding me back from joining communities of awesome like-minded people

## The Game Plan
I have a general idea of the game I'd like to make. It's a mishmosh of genres I enjoy:
- Deckbuilding
- Looters
- Roguelikes
- Looters
- Turn-based combat/strategy
- LOOTERS
- Action & Tabletop RPGs
- INEEDIT

I'm drawing inspiration from games like:
- Slay the Spire
- Dead Cells
- Diablo II
- Baldur's Gate 3
- Terraria
- Earthbound (Mother 2)
- Dominion
- Clank!
- Acension
- and countless others. seriously, there's too many to list here

So think:
- Cards
- Dice
- LOOT
- Stats and attributes (maybe)
- Procedurally generated areas and encounters
- Inventory management
- I mentioned loot, right?

Keep in mind, the primary goal here is to improve my Swift and SwiftUI knowledge (and maybe your knowledge too!). Developing a game that works, and one that is actually fun to play, are secondary and tertiary goals respectively.

More details to come.

## Target Platforms
I want to prioritize iPadOS and macOS because I feel like I'm going to need all the screen real estate I can get. But we'll see how it goes. I'd love to do something for visionOS too (that's more than just a flat projection of the game), but we're talking stretch goals now.

## Contributing
Honestly, I haven't thought that far ahead yet. For now, I invite you to engage with me on Mastodon if you have feedback you want to share. If by some wacky turn of events this experiment actually produces something worth maintaining, I'll revisit the idea.

## License
MIT? Sure, lets go with that.
